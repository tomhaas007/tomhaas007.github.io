       things marketing and currently discovering my love for coding and
       webdesign. I'm also intrested in Start-Ups and all kinds of creative
       ideas and projects aiming at changing the (business) world of today.

  <div class="interests">
    <h4>My interests.</h4>
      <p>Apart from my business interests I love travelling. Scandinavian
       countries have earned a special place in my heart (Sweden I love you),
       but I also love visiting more exotic countries in Asia and South America.
       Also, working out and being physically active is imprtant for me. Simply
       because you feel so much better after an exhausting work-out.
       Last but not least I love fashion. Probably relates to my interest into
       design. More here</br>
