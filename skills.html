    <h4>Business</h4>
      <p>I'm a business student currently doing my bachelor degree at ESB
        Business School Reutlingen.
        My interests and skills are mainly related to Marketing and Strategy.
        During my studies I was able to focus on this area of business
        and have acquired profound knowledge which I am looking forward to apply
        in practise.
        Moreover, I conducted an internship in an e-commerce Start-Up which
        allowed me to acquire further knowledge about Online Marketing and
        digitalisation.

    <h4>Languages</h4>
      <p>Languages have always been my interest which is propably related to my
        interest in travelling and exploring new places all over the world.
        Over the years I have constantly improved my language skills and am now
        certified C1 level English and Spanish speaker. I'm also okay at German.

          <h5>html5</h5>
          <p>The basic programming language for the web. My first coding
            language. Easier to learn than expected.

        <div class="grid">
          <h5>css3</h5>
          <p>Also known as the language that makes html beautiful. Super glad I

        <div class="grid">
          <h5>javascript</h5>
