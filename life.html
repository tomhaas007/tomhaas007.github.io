    <h4>About</h4>
    <p>I was born and raised in Germany. Curently I'm a business student,
     interested in all things marketing & strategy. That's what I focused on in
     my studies and where I see myself working at some point in my life. I'm also
     currently discovering my love for coding and webdesign. I'm very intrested
     in Start-Ups and all kinds of creative ideas and projects aiming at
     changing the (business) world of today.

    <h4>Interests</h4>
    <p>Apart from my business interests I love travelling. Scandinavian
     countries have earned a special place in my heart,
     but I'd also love to visit more exotic countries in Asia and South America.
     Also, working out and being physically active is important for me. It simply
     makes you feel good and nothing compares to the feeling after an exhausting
     work-out. Last but not least I love fashion. I'm trying to dress well and
     generally enjoy shopping and discovering new styles although I prefer simple
     and clean outfits over loud colorful stuff. This obviously also applies to
     coding and webdesign.
